.SH NAME
arch-update \- An update notifier/applier for Arch Linux that assists you with important pre/post update tasks.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arch-update
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
An update notifier/applier for Arch Linux that assists you with important pre/post update tasks and that includes a (.desktop) clickeable icon that can easily be integrated with any DE/WM, dock, status/launch bar or app menu.
.br
.RB "Optional support for AUR packages update (through " "yay " "or " "paru" "), Flatpak packages update (through " "flatpak" ") and desktop notifications (through " "libnotify" ")."

.SH OPTIONS
.PP
If no option is passed, launch the relevant series of functions to perform a complete and proper update starting by displaying the list of packages available for update, then ask for the user's confirmation to proceed with the installation.
.br
.RB "It also supports AUR packages update (if " "yay " "or " "paru " "is installed) and Flatpak packages update (if " "flatpak " "is installed)."
.br
Before performing the update, it offers to display the latest Arch Linux news to the user. By default, Arch news are only displayed if at least a new one has been published since the last run. Arch news published since the last run or at the same date are tagged as '[NEW]'.
.br
Arch-Update also checks for orphan packages, unused Flatpak packages, old and/or uninstalled cached packages in pacman's cache, pacnew/pacsave files and pending kernel update requiring a reboot to be applied and, if there are, offers to process them.
.br
Those functions are launched when you click on the (.desktop) icon.
